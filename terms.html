            <h2>1. Service Agreement</h2>
            <p>Payment of <strong>$2,500</strong> is required in full before development begins. The website will be delivered within <strong>7 business days</strong> from the start of development.</p>
            
            <p><strong>"Start of development"</strong> is defined as the date when the client has provided all necessary content including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Business information and company details</li>
                <li>All text, copy, and descriptions</li>
                <li>Photos, images, and logos</li>
                <li>Contact information and service descriptions</li>
                <li>Any other materials required to complete the website</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Revisions</h2>
            <p>Unlimited revisions are included <strong>during the 7-day development period only</strong>. All revision requests must be communicated and completed before final approval and launch.</p>
            
            <p>Once you approve the final website and it is launched, the revision period ends immediately. No further revisions, changes, or modifications will be provided.</p>

            <h2>4. Post-Launch Support</h2>
            <p><strong>Once the website is launched and you confirm acceptance of the final product, webre.co has NO obligation to provide:</strong></p>

            <p>You are responsible for providing all necessary content in a timely manner. Delays in providing required materials may extend the delivery timeline.</p>

            </ul>

            <h2>10. Timeline & Delivery</h2>
            <p>The 7-day delivery timeline begins only after you provide all required content. If you request significant changes to the project scope after development has begun, the timeline may be extended at our discretion.</p>
            
            <p>We will make reasonable efforts to meet deadlines, but we are not liable for any damages resulting from delivery delays.</p>

            <h2>11. Scope Changes</h2>
            <p>The project scope is defined during the initial consultation call. Requests that fall outside the original scope may require additional fees and timeline extensions.</p>
            
            <p>Adding new pages, features, or functionality beyond what was originally discussed constitutes a scope change and may be declined or quoted separately.</p>

            <h2>12. Content Accuracy</h2>

                <li>Copyright or trademark infringement in your materials</li>
                <li>Legal compliance of your business practices</li>
                <li>Claims made in your content</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>13. Termination</h2>
            <p>Either party may terminate this agreement before development begins with full refund. Once development begins, no refunds will be issued under any circumstances.</p>

            <h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>Any disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. You waive any right to a jury trial.</p>

            <h2>15. Entire Agreement</h2>
